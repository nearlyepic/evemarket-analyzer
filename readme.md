# My Personal EVE Online Market Analyzer
This is a small tool I wrote for myself to manage my market orders while trading in EVE Online.
It integrates with a tool that I wrote before, which you can find on my github profile.
It also makes use of PhealNG, a PHP library that handles cURLing and caching of EVE Online's XML API.
There are no frameworks here, be warned.
