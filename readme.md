# My Personal EVE Online Market Analyzer
This is a small tool I wrote for myself to manage my market orders while trading in EVE Online.

It integrates with a tool that I wrote before, which you can find on my github profile.

It also makes use of PhealNG, a PHP library that handles cURLing and caching of EVE Online's XML API.

There are no frameworks here, be warned.

This uses bootstrap instead of just plain HTML. It also uses an XHR to process logins instead of a standard HTML form.
